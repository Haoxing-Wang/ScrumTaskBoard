BEFORE RUNNING THE CODE

This solution was completed using Java with Eclipse (JDK 1.8), there is one more step needed in order to run the code.

1. Import the folder taskBoardProject to your Eclipse, by importing the existing projects to workspace

2. In terms of the second step, in Eclipse, you need to find the file ExecuteOption.java under src folder, and change the line 52.

	Since the XMLFile is used to save all the changes made, therefore, its location needs to be changed accordingly.
	
	In my case, I save it to /Users/haoxingwang/Documents

	You have to change this path in order to successfully create an XML file and save all the changes.

	For example, XMLFile = new File(c:\\test\\file.xml) in Windows


RUNNING THE CODE

1. In terminal, change your working directory to bin folder under folder taskBoardProject
	
	In my case the working directory would be /Users/haoxingwang/Documents/workspace/taskBoardProject/bin

2. Run the code using commands required in this assessment (create, list, delete, move, update and complete):
	
	java taskBoard.Main -create -story 1 'this is my first user story'

	or

	java taskBoard.Main -list -stories

	and etc.

3. If it throws "Error: Could not find or load main class taskBoard.Main"

	then, it is necessary to add the project to classpath.

	In my case, as my working directory is /Users/haoxingwang/Documents/workspace/taskBoardProject/bin

	So that's export CLASSPATH=/Users/haoxingwang/Documents/workspace/taskBoardProject/bin:$CLASSPATH and run the command again
